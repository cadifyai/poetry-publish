# pypi-poetry-publish

Opinionated GitHub action to fully automate publishing packages to PyPI - using Poetry and GitHub releases.

We published this action because we use it in our projects and thought it would be useful to others as well. This action is **open to any kind of
collaboration and contribution** - We're happy to receive feedback, issues, pull requests or just kudos.

## Features

- Automatically publish your package to PyPI when you create a new release on GitHub
- Publish to the public PyPI, the TestPyPI, or a custom PyPI registry
- Runs on private GitHub Actions runners
- Support for private PyPI repository dependencies
- Configurable **Python version**, **Poetry**, and **Poetry Core version** for specific needs
- Configurable branch e.g. `main`, `master`, `beta`, etc.

	- [Publish to public PyPI](#publish-to-public-pypi)
	- [With private dependencies](#with-private-dependencies)
	- [To a private PyPI](#publish-to-a-private-pypi)
	- [With private dependencies](#with-private-dependencies)

## Prerequisites

This action assumes you use [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) as your package manager and have the `pyproject.toml` and `poetry.lock` files in the root directory of your
repository.

```
my_project/
├─ example_package/
│  ├─ __init__.py
├─ pyproject.toml
├─ poetry.lock
```

> :information_source: If you do not use a custom runner, you may use the builtin functionality `GITHUB_TOKEN` with write permissions as the `ACCESS_TOKEN` as seen in the first
> example.
> See [https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication#using-the-github_token-in-a-workflow](https://docs.github.
> com/en/actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication#using-the-github_token-in-a-workflow)

> :warning: We recommend you to use this workflow with the test PyPI registry e.g. `PUBLISH_REGISTRY: "https://test.pypi.org/simple/"` until you can confirm your workflow works as
> expected.

## Minimal example

```yaml
name: Build and publish python package

on:
  release:
    types: [ published ]

jobs:
  publish-service-client-package:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: write
    steps:
      - name: Publish PyPi package
        uses: code-specialist/pypi-poetry-publish@v1
        with:
          ACCESS_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          PUBLISH_REGISTRY_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.PYPI_TOKEN }}
```

## Process

1. You create a new Release and Tag e.g. `1.0.0` (Trigger)
2. The action will:
	1. build your package
	2. adjust the version in the `pyproject.toml` and `__init__.py` in the package directory according to the tag
	3. publish the package to a PyPI registry

## Example process

### Before the release

**./pyproject.toml**

```toml
[tool.poetry]
name = "code-specialist-example-package"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "Example package"
authors = ["Code Specialist"]
packages = [{include = "example_package"}]


[tool.poetry.dependencies]
python = "^3.10"
```

**./example_package/__init__.py**

```python
__version__ = "0.1.0"
```

### After GitHub Release 1.0.0

The action will alter the content of your repository to avoid conflicts and version mismatches:

**pyproject.toml**

```toml
[tool.poetry]
name = "code-specialist-example-package"
version = "1.0.0" # adjusted to 1.0.0
description = "Example package"
authors = ["Code Specialist"]
packages = [{include = "example_package"}]


[tool.poetry.dependencies]
python = "^3.10"
```

**./example_package/__init__.py**

```python
__version__ = "1.0.0"  # adjusted to 1.0.0
```

## Examples

Each example requires you to:

1. Create a workflow file e.g. `.github/workflows/publish.yaml`
2. Create a new release and tag e.g. `1.0.0` and the action will be triggered and publishes your package

> :information_source: If there is a use case you would like to see, please open an issue or a pull request.

### Publish to Public PyPI

- Requires GitHub secrets:
	- `PUBLISH_REGISTRY_PASSWORD` with a valid token

In order to use the `GITHUB_TOKEN` you also have to provide permissions for the token. In this case you require the `contents:write` permission.

**publish.yaml**
```yaml
name: Build and publish python package

on:
  release:
    types: [ published ]

jobs:
  publish-service-client-package:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: write
    steps:
      - name: Publish PyPi package
        uses: code-specialist/pypi-poetry-publish@v1
        with:
          PACKAGE_DIRECTORY: "./example-package/"
          PYTHON_VERSION: "3.10"
          ACCESS_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          PUBLISH_REGISTRY_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.PUBLISH_REGISTRY_PASSWORD }}
```

### Publish Test PyPI

- Requires GitHub secrets:
    - `PUBLISH_REGISTRY_PASSWORD` with a valid token
    - `ACCESS_TOKEN` access token with write access to the GitHub repository

**publish.yaml**
```yaml
name: Build and publish python package

on:
  release:
    types: [ published ]

jobs:
  publish-service-client-package:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Publish PyPi package
        uses: code-specialist/pypi-poetry-publish@v1
        with:
          PACKAGE_DIRECTORY: "./example-package/"
          PYTHON_VERSION: "3.10"
          ACCESS_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.ACCESS_TOKEN }}
          PUBLISH_REGISTRY_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.PUBLISH_REGISTRY_PASSWORD }}
          PUBLISH_REGISTRY: "https://test.pypi.org/legacy/"
```

### Publish to a Private PyPI

- Requires GitHub secrets:
	- `PUBLISH_REGISTRY_USER` username for the PyPI registry
	- `PUBLISH_REGISTRY_PASSWORD` with the password for the `PUBLISH_REGISTRY_USER` user
	- `ACCESS_TOKEN` access token with write access to the GitHub repository

**publish.yaml**
```yaml
name: Build and publish python package

on:
  release:
    types: [ published ]

jobs:
  publish-service-client-package:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Publish PyPI package
        uses: code-specialist/pypi-poetry-publish@v1
        with:
          PACKAGE_DIRECTORY: "./example-package/"
          PYTHON_VERSION: "3.10"
          ACCESS_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.ACCESS_TOKEN }}
          PUBLISH_REGISTRY_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.PUBLISH_REGISTRY_PASSWORD }}
          PUBLISH_REGISTRY_USER: ${{ secrets.PUBLISH_REGISTRY_USER }}
          PUBLISH_REGISTRY: "https://pypi.code-specialist.com/simple/"
```

###  With Private Dependencies

- Requires GitHub secrets:
  - `ACCESS_TOKEN` access token with write access to the GitHub repository
  - `PUBLISH_REGISTRY_USER` username for the PyPI registry
  - `PUBLISH_REGISTRY_PASSWORD` with the password for the `PUBLISH_REGISTRY_USER` user
  - `POETRY_DEPENDENCY_REGISTRY_USERNAME` username for the custom registry
  - `POETRY_DEPENDENCY_REGISTRY_PASSWORD` password for the custom registry

**publish.yaml**
```yaml
name: Build and publish python package

on:
  release:
    types: [ published ]

jobs:
  publish-service-client-package:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Publish PyPI package
      uses: code-specialist/pypi-poetry-publish@v1
      with:
        ACCESS_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.ACCESS_TOKEN }}
        PUBLISH_REGISTRY_USER: ${{ secrets.PUBLISH_REGISTRY_USER }}
        PUBLISH_REGISTRY_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.PUBLISH_REGISTRY_PASSWORD }}
        PUBLISH_REGISTRY: "https://pypi.code-specialist.com"
        POETRY_DEPENDENCY_REGISTRY_URL: "https://pypi.code-specialist.com"
        POETRY_DEPENDENCY_REGISTRY_NAME: "codespecialist"
        POETRY_DEPENDENCY_REGISTRY_USERNAME: ${{ secrets.CUSTOM_PUBLISH_REGISTRY_USERNAME }}
        POETRY_DEPENDENCY_REGISTRY_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.CUSTOM_PUBLISH_REGISTRY_PASSWORD }}
```

For this to install the dependency `private-code-specialist-example-package` from `https://pypi.code-specialist.com/simple/`, the corresponding `pyproject.toml` would look like
this:

```toml
[tool.poetry]
name = "code-specialist-example-package"
version = "1.0.0" # adjusted to 1.0.0
description = "Example package"
authors = ["Code Specialist"]
packages = [{include = "example_package"}]

[[tool.poetry.source]]
name = "codespecialist"
url = "https://pypi.code-specialist.com"

[tool.poetry.dependencies]
python = "^3.10"
private-code-specialist-example-package = {version = "^1.0.0", source = "codespecialist"}
```
